# Figma Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning Figma. As a beginner, I'm starting with the fundamentals and plan to explore more advanced topics over time. 
## Learning Resources

My primary source of learning will be high-quality content from YouTube. I will be referencing tutorials and courses from creators who are experts in the field.

## Goals

*   To gain a solid understanding of Figma's core features.
*   To be able to create and prototype user interfaces.
*   To build a portfolio of design projects.

## Progress

I will be tracking my progress and sharing my work in this repository.
